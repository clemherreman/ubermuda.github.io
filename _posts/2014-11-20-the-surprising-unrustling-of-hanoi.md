Visiting Vietnam was bound to hold a lot of surprises for me, since it's not a country I know very well. Sure it has a long common history with France, and I've seen Forrest Gump and a few other movies about the USA's struggle here, but that's about it.  I also had read bad things about vietnamese people (spoiler: it's just not true, vietnamese people are super friendly), and was overall thinking the country was still in control of the military.

I'm not sure about that last thing, since I didn't get to dig into vietnamese politics yet, but the first thing I noticed when landing in Hanoi was the austerity, then the military. Vietnam is one of those country where, as a french citizen, you need to buy a visa to get in. It's worth noting because a french passport (and most western-countries passports) usually gets you inside most countries for a few months for free.

Anyway, we bought a recommendation letter online back in Hong Kong and here we are at Hanoi's airport *visa on arrival* desk. The whole process is very formal, but fast and efficient. About 10 minutes later, we have our visas and pass security and immigration.

The third thing I noticed in Vietnam is the transportation. Being the adventurers that we are, we set off to join Hanoi from the airport by bus. Here, in my opinion, starts the real experience of urban Vietnam. You could take a taxi, or a shuttle, but you would really be missing on something. Roads in vietnam are kind of a do-what-you-want infrastructure. You use it however you see fit, respecting – or not – the highway code. Most vietnamese in Hanoi seem to go by motorbike. There are a few bikes and cars, a bit more buses, but really, most of the traffic is composed of motorbikes.

Traffic in Hanoi is an endless stream of motorbikes. And I do mean endless. It literally never stops, not even to respect a stop light (although most cars do). When you want to cross roads, you need to insert yourself into the traffic and trust the motorbikes to avoid you. So far everything went better than expected, but I'm still being extra cautious when crossing large roads. Oh and by the way, walkways are for parking motorbikes, not walking, silly you!

The second big difference with western-style transportation is the usage of the horn. Here, the horn is not used to alert someone of an imminent danger, but rather as a mean to declare your presence. For example, when you're taking a turn, you honk so people know you're here.

The direct consequence of this is the city is noisy and polluted. Everywhere you go, you hear horns and smell gas and smokes. I must admit at first I was a bit upset about that. I need my share of tranquility, and people who know me know I dislike noise in general (and that's an euphemism).

Yet, there is something unsetlling in the life of the city of Hanoi. People just don't seem to care. I witnessed an interesting scene where two cars tried to pass through a one-way street in opposing direction at the same time, effectively blocking the street. I was expecting honking and stuff, but there was not (apart from initial "I'm going to pass" honking and honking from motorbikes passing through). I was expecting the drivers to get mad at each others, but they did not. They just started looking for a solution, maneuvering (yes fellow french-speaking readers, this is an actual english word) their cars so one of them could pass and unclog the street. This scene just could not have taken place in France.

So basically, my first impression of Hanoi was that of a polluted and noisy city, but quickly transformed. I really like the way people there just go about their life, and seem to be nice to each other. It's relaxing to know that whatever happens, no one's gonna be mad at you, or judge you. You could say my jimmies has been unrustled, if you know what I mean (and if you don't you probably wouldn't understand anyway).

And then there's the food. If you know me, you know it's a very important subject for me, so it really deserves another blog post just about it!

In the meantime, [here are my pictures of Hanoi](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mirmozibang/sets/72157646931488023/)! There are not so much because I spent a lot of time working, but there will be more of Ha Long and Hue later.
