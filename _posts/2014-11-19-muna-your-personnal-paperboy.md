The internet is a formidable source of content. Everyday, tons and tons of content is created and thrown to the masses for consumption. Everyone has his own way of managing this flux of information, which may or may not be effective.

I personally like to use Twitter's favoriting feature as a way of marking content for later reading and I know I'm not the only one. My problem with this is my memory and my lack of self-discipline with time management. I always forget to check my read-it-later list, and when I stumble upon some in the depths of my twitter favorites. Obviously that is less than optimal.

That's why I built [Muna](https://muna.io/). Muna is a dead simple service that monitors your Twitter favorites and send you an email everyday with a list of what you favorited the day before. Simple enough. Muna also has a very basic notion of content freshness and expiration: any content that has not been read will be re-presented later in another section of the reading list. That way, even if you do not read everything you favorited yesterday, you'll still have a chance to catch-up some day (tomorrow if you're not too much behind on your readings) when it resurfaces.

The immediate benefit is that whenever an interesting content shows up in my twitter timeline (or somewhere else, Muna has a bookmarklet for conveniently adding content from any web page), I do not feel obligated to read it right away. I just favorite-and-forget it. The second benefit is that I now have a fixed – and up to some point enforced – schedule for catching-up on my readings, which makes things easier than ever for me.

And that's the core of it. Of course, that's rather simplistic and will not fit everyone. I have a number of features planned though for the coming weeks that should make the service useful for a larger audience (in no particular order): offline reading lists, support for more content sources such as Pocket or Instapaper, delivery to your favorite e-reader device, and some more.

Muna's long-term goal is to help you managing your reading-time better and reading higher quality content. The managing part is well on its way already, and if you're interested in the reading higher quality content part, you should [follow Muna on twitter](https://twitter.com/munahq) or register to [the Muna newsletter](http://muna.io/newsletter), where future announcements will be held!

Of course, you can already [signup for Muna](https://muna.io/#signup) itself and start enjoying a new peace of mind in your everyday connected life (not tested scientifically).
