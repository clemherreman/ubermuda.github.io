It has been a week since I left France already, and it has been quite a busy week. As many of you may already know, I spent the week in Hong Kong, and am now in Hanoi, Vietnam (more about that later).

First, what's going on? Simply put, [Pieter](https://levels.io) unknowingly motivated me to make the big step. I've been thinking about it for a few years now, toying with the idea and always finding a good reason not to do it (moving to Canada, starting my business, that sort of things). This year has been particularly turbulent for me, but let's just say I failed my first business (don't be sad, it's ok to fail) and started to do freelance job while working on my other side projects (something to be announced soon), and my [docker book](https://geoffrey.io/books/discovering-docker.html) (to be released soon too).

Anyway, thinking about my current situation – no full-time contract, mostly remote clients – made me realize now would be the ideal time to try something.

So here I am, in Asia. First stop, Hong Kong, because I had some matters to attend there. My first glimpse at Hong Kong was nowhere near what I expected from the town. I imagined Hong Kong like a giant modern city. It's actually a bit of that, but not only. Trying to reduce expenses for the first part of my trip, I settled in a [cheap yet comfortable dorm I found on AirBnb](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/298022) in Kowloon. The thing I didn't realize was it's located in a popular district of Hong Kong. There are buildings, right, but they are not modern.

In my mind of privilegied westerner, and just because Hong Kong was still part of the British Empire not so long ago (given my terrible memory, things I can remember are by default "not so long ago" for me), I imaged Hong Kong a lot more "western-ish" than it actually is. It might sound crazy if you don't have the sort of bias I personnaly have, but Hong Kong is a lot more chinese than I expected it to be.

Exploring the district was always a source of marveling. The dorm was located right in the center of Sham Shui Po's flea market. If you're used to western style market, a chinese flea market is kinda disturbing. Stalls are everywhere on each side of the street, people flowing in and out. Goods are disposed on tables, or directly on the floor if there's no space left on the tables, and merchants don't really bother calling you out to buy their stuff. It's like, man, if you need something just ask me, I'm not going to force you anyway. In contrast to that, there are more "professionnal" shop-stalls. These ones have people praising their products using a loudspeaker, and often attract groups of onlooker. Most of the time, they are tech-shop trying to sell phones (either counterfeits or not), TV sets, and the such.

And of course, in the middle of all of this are the food stalls.  Food is cheap in Hong Kong, and you can get a full meal in the street for as much as 40 Hong Kong dollars (that's about 4 euros). Most of the time restaurants do have an english menu, but occasionally you'll stumble upon one that doesn't. That's not big deal though, they seems to be used to it and will often propose things they know you can and will eat (mostly, rice, curry, noodles). The fun part is you rarely know what you're actually ordering, and you'll only find out when the plates arrive at your table. Even then, sometimes, you still don't know what you're eating, but that's part of the game!

Now that's only one part of Hong Kong, and of course, there's the island of Hong Kong itself with all the business buildings and stuff. In my opinion, that's far from being the most interesting part of HK. It's a mandatory passing point to get to Victoria Peak, where you can enjoy the famous view on Hong Kong bay, but apart from that, it doesn't seem that interesting (I could be wrong though since I did not visit it).

All in all, the week passed rather quickly, and before I realized, I found myself in a plane to Hanoi (Vietnam), but that is another story that I'll be happy to tell in another blog post!
