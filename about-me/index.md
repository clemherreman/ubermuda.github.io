Hi there, I'm Geoffrey, an independent developer who also does devops and traveling.

Do not hesitate to [drop me a note](mailto:geoffrey.bachelet@gmail.com) if you're looking for an amazing freelancer for your Symfony2 project, or for anything Docker-related, I'd love to discuss your project(s) with you! You can find a detailed [resume](https://linkedin.com/in/gbachelet) on LinkedIn, but here's a quick recap anyway.

## Web Development

I'm mostly proficient in PHP and using the Symfony2 framework. I have ten years experience in web development, so you can trust that I will take good care of your project. The diversity of my skillset makes me a very good choice for bootstraping, but also for consulting sessions, auditing your existing codebase or training your team.

## Devops

I also do devops! I'm a huge fan of Docker, and have been using it since 0.3. As a matter of fact, I created, open-sourced and maintain [Stage1](http://stage1.io/), an automated staging platform based on Docker ([sources](https://github.com/stage1/stage1)). I also created [Docker-PHP](https://github.com/stage1/docker-php/) and a few other Docker related projects that you can see [on GitHub](https://github.com/stage1).

## Traveling

I love to travel, and aspire to a more nomad way of life. I've been to Sweden (twice), Japan (twice too), England, Ireland, Denmark, Czech Republic, Italy, The Netherlands, The USA, and lived in Montreal for one and a half years. I also visited a lot of places in my homeland, France, and currently live in Lyon while planning a 3 months trip in south-east Asia.

## Misc

I also love to attend conferences, especially as a speaker. I've been touring the AFUP's conferences tour for a while now (see [Introduction Ã  Docker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2ishjaK_Ag&index=10&list=PL9zDdgiGjkIefshKss_VCoSPw4W0n1UHq) and [Comprendre Git](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5fJO-nd1Po)), and would love to broaden my speaking experience to international conferences. I'm also engaged in numerous local user groups in Lyon since I created the AFUP's first local outlet here, helped create the AFSY Symfony User Group, and manage Lyon's Docker User Group.

I also occasionnaly show up at companies for short talks about whatever could be interesting for the people there, usually something about Docker or Symfony ([send me an email](mailto:geoffrey.bachelet@gmail.com) if you would like me to talk at your company, it's free if I'm in your area!).

Last but not least, I like to write. I wrote two chapters in the [More with symfony](http://symfony.com/legacy/doc/more-with-symfony) book ([Symfony Internals](http://symfony.com/legacy/doc/more-with-symfony/1_4/en/10-Symfony-Internals)) and ([Leveraging the power of the CLI](http://symfony.com/legacy/doc/more-with-symfony/1_4/en/13-Leveraging-the-Power-of-the-Command-Line)), and I'm now trying the adventure on my own with a Docker book. More about that very soon.
